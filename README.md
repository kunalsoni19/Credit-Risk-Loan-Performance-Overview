# Credit Risk & Loan Performance Overview (Power BI)

## Project Title
**Credit Risk & Loan Performance Dashboard – Power BI**

## Short Description / Purpose
This project is part of my journey as a **Business Analyst aspirant**.  
I explored real-world loan data from **Kaggle** and built an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to understand **credit risk, loan performance, and borrower behavior**.  

The goal was to **identify risky loan segments** and highlight KPIs that matter to financial institutions when making lending decisions.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Power BI** – Data cleaning, modeling, DAX, and dashboard design  
- **Excel** – Pre-processing and validation  
- **Kaggle Dataset** – Real-world loan and borrower data  

---

## Data Structure
- **Borrower Profile** → Loan amount, grade (A–G), purpose, term  
- **Loan Performance** → Defaulted vs Completed status  
- **KPIs** → Default rate %, loan distribution by grade, category-level risk, repayment trends  

---

## Features / Highlights
- **Overall Loan Portfolio Analysis** → Found **19.96% default rate** across 269K loans  
- **Risk by Loan Grade** → Grades **D through G defaulted much higher** than average → critical red flag  
- **Purpose-Based Risk** → **Small Business loans defaulted the most** compared to other purposes  
- **Interactive KPIs & Filters** → Loan grade, purpose, term, and risk segments  
- **Clear Insights for Action** → Dashboard helps lenders **prioritize safe segments** and **rethink exposure in risky categories**  

---

## Result | Action | Context (RAC Approach)

- **Result** → Highlighted that nearly **1 in 5 loans defaulted**, with small business loans and grades D–G being the riskiest.  
- **Action** → Cleaned, modeled, and visualized Kaggle loan data using **Power BI** with custom KPIs and filters.  
- **Context** → Supports decision-making for financial institutions by showing **where risk is concentrated** and how it compares across loan segments.
